							<h3><a href="https://indeedhi.re/3AhpSNg" target="_blank">Click here for my ideal job </a></h3>
							<p>This is a position for a data analyst. The thing that stands out the most to me for this position is designing ways for clients to read trends and assist in their business ventures.
								The company also states that they want everyone to feel the most comfortable at work and they will do what they can for people to feel comfortable and express themselves as they are.
								Furthermore, the salary of $90,000 - $130,000 is something that also entices me. </p>
							<p>Some skills and experience that is needed for this position require fluency in programming languages such as Python, R and other programming languages and having at least 2 years within the field of data analytics already –
								being aware of external factors that may impact the client’s outcome. They also require a level of experience working with various cloud technologies such as AWS, GCP or Azure. 	</p>
							<p> The skills that I currently possess that can lead me towards this position is only having learnt basic Python programming. <br>
							I believe that I can obtain a further understanding and develop my skills on Python through various courses at RMIT,
							but for me to have a better understanding in other languages I will have to spend my own time studying these outside of the course. <br>
							Learning to use the tools that are required may also be taught through courses within or outside of university by doing internships and working in other workplaces
							 will give me the best experience before applying for jobs. </p>

							<h3 class="personalprofile">Personal Profile</h3>
							<p >These tests give a general overview as to the kind of person that I could be and may seem to be from a subjective point of view. <br>
								The results show that I am generally an outgoing person and enjoy spending my time with others and someone who tends to make decisions as I go. <br>
								Having the EST-P personality trait from the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, it states that “as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, [I’ll] gladly pull [my] own” (Workplace Habits | Entrepreneur (ESTP) Personality | 16Personalities, 2021) which I do believe is true. <br>
								So, when thinking about forming teams, I want to ensure that my colleagues are also capable of putting in the work and we can both put in the effort to complete the task at hand. </p>
							<p>When conducting the IPIP Big Five Factor Markers Test, it gave me the resolute of extroversion for the Factor I. Meaning that I am someone who shows “surgency or positive emotionality”. <br>
								This will play a part in picking teams, as I will be more inclined to work with other people and have little difficulty speaking to them (Big Five Personality Test Results, 2021).  </p>
							<p>The results from the Learning Style Test were quite interesting. I had the result of someone who is a “tactile learner” (What's Your Learning Style? The Results, 2021). <br>
								This means that I am someone who leans by touching and doing. Being able to experience what is being taught firsthand opposed to being told or being shown how to do something. The test also suggests ways that can assist in the way that I learn things which can be seen down below. </p>
							<p>All in all, these tests are just an extremely vague way to grasp the type of person that you may be, but they are a good way in pointing yourself in the right direction if you’re trying to grasp the type of person you are. </p>
