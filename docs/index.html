							<h3>About Me</h3>
								<p>I’m 23 years old and I'm a Chinese/Vietnamese student who was born and raised in Melbourne. </p>
								<p> During a lot of my spare time, I enjoy playing video games. I generally like to play games on my PC, mainly playing League of Legends and RPG games on both console and PC. Currently,
								 my favourite game that I have recently played is “God of War” on PlayStation as it is an action, RPG with an amazing plot.</p>
								 <p>When I’m not playing games, I spend my time working out as I participate in the sport of powerlifting. A sport where contestants compete in the squat, bench and deadlift and aim for the biggest total within three attempts.
								 My personal best lifts are 201kg squat, 132.5kg bench press and 240kg deadlift, making my best total 572.5kg.</p>
								 <p>I also own two beautiful cats, one orange named Nacho who is now 4 years old, and a black and white named Myla who is 2 years old (they don't get along).

							<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
							<p>My interest in IT is mainly artificial intelligence. What is most interesting is the fact that a lot of our day-to-day lives now revolve around the use of AI whether we realise it or not.
								Furthermore, the use of AI has made a lot of our tasks easier. Something that really grabbed my attention was Nvidia announcing their thing called “RTX Voice” which allowed users to block out
								most, if not all, background noise when using the microphone (NVIDIA RTX Voice: Setup Guide, 2021). This was achieved using their 20-series graphics cards, which I thought was super handy given the climate that we we're in.</p>
							<p>Some other small things that interest me in AI are smart assistants. Just being able use voice to produce a result opposed to having to type is neat and convenient to me.
								 Also, how maps is able to determine the ETA (which is decently accurate), when using maps on a smartphone.	</p>
							<p>The first instance that sparked my interest in IT was picking parts and building my first PC when I was 14. Luckily enough the PC has lasted me 10+ years and I have recently put
								together a new machine
								<a href="#pcparts">(Click here for the list)</a>. I also take a lot of interest in picking out PC parts for my friends and family when they need a new PC. </p>
							<p>I have had a little experience in IT in my previous university where I was also studying a bachelor in IT, but not too much outside of that. After spending a year at my previous university,
								 I came to realise that they couldn’t provide the level of education I was after and my friend, who is also a student at RMIT, recommended me to transfer to RMIT. So, I am looking to learn
								 a lot of skills at RMIT that I can utilise within my university and work life.  </p>
