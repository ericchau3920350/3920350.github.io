							<h3>Project Overview</h3>
							<p>The project idea is to create an app that creates recipes and recipe ideas based on food items in your fridge. <br>
								 It will use the camera to get a general idea and the user will be able to input ingredients into a list if the camera is unable to detect certain items. </p>
							<p>	It will also have a function where users are able to input their calorie intake for the day and/or their macronutrient breakdown. <br>
								This function allows for users to also determine whether the ingredients that they have will fit within their daily caloric and macronutrient (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) intake, if that is something that the user is concerned about. </p>

							<h3>Motivation Behind the Project</h3>
							<p>As most households have a fridge, we often get stuck looking into the fridge and unsure as to what to cook or what to eat. <br>
								So, using this sort of app will remove the dilemma of not knowing what to make or if there’s anything quick and easy that can be made. <br>
								Using the phone camera will make this extremely easy to use and most people have a smartphone that would be able to download this app.</p>
							<p>Being a competitor in a sport, being powerlifting, watching my weight, and making sure that I am consuming good foods and ensuring that I am sticking to my daily caloric intake, as well as my macronutrients. <br>
								That is why the function of having caloric and macronutrient breakdown is a handy function that I believe can benefit those who are in sports, as well as everyday individuals who wish to watch what they are eating. <br>
								Sometimes I personally don't have enough time to go grocery shopping for the week and may have some leftover ingredients from earlier in the week, so having something think of a recipe based on what is available to me makes it super easy and convenient.</p>

							<h3>Description of the Project</h3>
							<p>The app will utilise the rear facing camera of smartphones that are updated to the latest versions. This will include Android, iOS, Microsoft, and Windows.<br>
								 When opening the app for the first time, the user will need to grant the app permissions to use the camera and locations if they wish to utilise the app to its fullest. Once the user has completed that, the app will run as it would normally, having drop down menus along the front screen and having the camera trying to detect cooking items. </p>
							<p>Within the display of the app there will be a drop-down menu where the user can access things such as, their profile if they choose to sign up, a place to upload recipes for other users, a place where users can input a list of items that are contained within their fridge and app settings. </p>
							<p>Within the user profile, there will also be an option to input bodyweight and a target bodyweight. By doing so, the user can track their bodyweight and see how their progress is going. <br>
								This will go alongside a calorie and/or macronutrient tracker. Without tracking calories or macronutrients there will be no use in trying to gain or lose weight as individuals will not be able to guess the amount of food they’re consuming.
							<p>	When creating a profile, the user will be able to upload recipes, comment on other users’ recipes and rate them. Adding this sort of function will increase the database of recipes that the app can provide users when wanting to cook something. It will also create a small community of home cooks that share the same idea of quickly putting together a meal. </p>
							<p>Having the option to manually input items to a list is crucial to the app. This ensures that anything that the camera can’t pick up or is unable to identify can be quickly overcome by the user. Once the app has been able to get the items into a list it can then search through the library of recipes that it contains and show a recipe to the user.</p>
							<p>Having location services turned on will allow users to check if local grocery stores have certain items in stock, if the items at home aren’t sufficient for a recipe the user has selected. Thus, making it easy to go out and quickly pick up a couple of items before starting the cooking process. </p>

							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>If the project is successful, it will help many individuals across the world by assisting with at home kitchen dilemmas. Putting together thought out meals and recipes for the average Joe, and also
							people that are wanting to watch what they are eating. This will more heavily impact those who are constantly stuck with the problem of not knowing what to cook with little ingredients they have, more than
							it would with someone who is not actively looking to do so.  </p>
